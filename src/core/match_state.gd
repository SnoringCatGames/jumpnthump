extends MultiplayerSynchronizer


# FIXME: LEFT OFF HERE: ACTUALLY:
# - Maintain a list of all active players.
# - Auto-assign a cute bunny name and cute adjective to each player when they connect.
# - Record players and names here.
# - HAVE THE SYNC SETTINGS be reliable an on-change.
# - Refactor session:
#   - Rename it to be LocalSession.
#   - MatchState is then the networked session stuff.
